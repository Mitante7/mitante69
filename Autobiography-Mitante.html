<h1> My Autobiography </h1>
<title>Jessabelle's autobiography</title>
</head>
    <body>My name is Jessabelle D. Mitante, and I was born on July 25, 2005, in Malila, Tampilisan, Zamboanga del Norte. My parents names are Bernard G. Mitante and Jennifer D. Mitante. I have one brother, and his name is Jubert D. Mitante.

        <p></p>There are a lot of things I like and don't like. I like to have fun with my friends; I love watching movies and listening to OPM songs; but what I really love is spending time with my family and reading Wattpad in my free time. Some of my friends are asking me, "Why do you like reading Wattpad a lot?" Well, Wattpad books combine the depth, insight, and imagination of a real-life story, so i don't have to worry about making something look realistic. When I used to read a Wattpad book, the art created the world. It may look like the character is better compared to reality, but it's'real' in terms of imagining it's reality. It also gives me happiness and peace.
         <p></p>The foods I don't like are burger, bread with onion, durian, and etc. The other food I don't like is ''Hipon''; my parents say it tastes good and is yummy, but my mouth says no. But the thing I really don't like the most is when my mom passed away. It was heartbreaking, but her memory continues to live within me.Her touch was comforting, and I knew that everything would be okay as long as she was there with me. She is my confidante, my motivator, and my biggest supporter through thick and thin. Even though she is no longer here with me, I still feel her presence in my life. I know that she is watching over me and guiding me, just as she did when she was alive.
         <p></p>My goals in life are to study hard, get my dream job, and give my family a better life than what I promised my mom when she was alive. I also have an inspirational quote, and I would like to share it with you: “You have to believe in yourself when no one else does.” —Carol Burnett. I always relay my life to this quote; this means that no matter how hard life is, I would still fight, and you should believe in yourself even if the world is against you, and even if there is a time you want to give up, just talk to them and say, "You can do it." I am also inspired by my beloved mother and grandmother. Lastly, however, it's important to remember that the lessons and values that she instilled in me will stay with me for a lifetime. She told me to believe in myself and pursue my dreams. Even though life is full of challenges, my mother may have taught me how to face them with grace and determination. When I encounter difficult times, I remember the strength and resilience that she demonstrated. I         cherish those memories, and I use them as a source of strength and inspiration as I move forward in life.
